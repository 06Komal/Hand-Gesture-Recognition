# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
Built a real-time AI assistant integrating hand-gesture recognition with a Jarvis-style voice system. Implemented gestures (swipe, zoom, single/double click) using OpenCV/MediaPipe and mapped them to system actions. Integrated voice/gesture control to open apps, websites, answer queries, and play YouTube music for seamless hands-free interaction.
